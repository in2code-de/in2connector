ConnectionAlreadyDemandedException
==================================

Thrown by \In2code\In2connector\Registry\ConnectionRegistry because the connection identity key was already used to
demand a connection.

Identity keys must be unique. You MUST not register another connection for an existing identity key. Use another key.
Your key should look like this: <package>|<somestring>

<package> is the EXTKEY of your extension
<somestring> should be concerned with the usage of the connection (e.g. ldap_for_import)
