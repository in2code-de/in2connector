DriverNameAlreadyRegisteredException
====================================

Thrown by \In2code\In2connector\Registry\ConnectionRegistry because a driver was already registered with the given name.

Driver names can be registered only once, to prevent overwriting of driver classes.
To replace a driver class with another consider the extbase configuration to replace the class name.
You should use ConnectionRegistry::deregisterDriver() only when there is no other option!
