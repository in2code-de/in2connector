DriverNameNotRegistered
=======================

Thrown by \In2code\In2connector\Registry\ConnectionRegistry because no driver was registered for the given name.

The driver you tried to unset was never registered with this name. Check the loading order of your extensions and
spelling of the name. Use the defined constant if possible.
